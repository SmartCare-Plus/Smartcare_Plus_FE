## 🔍 Research Problem

The elderly population, especially individuals with **arthritis and mobility limitations**, faces multiple challenges:

- Increased risk of **falls and fall-related injuries**
- Lack of **real-time monitoring** when caregivers are unavailable
- Difficulty maintaining **balanced nutrition**
- Inappropriate or unsafe **exercise routines**
- Fragmented care solutions that do not work together

🔴 **Existing systems** often focus on only one aspect (health tracking or emergency alerts) and fail to provide a **holistic, preventive, and proactive solution**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a **Smart Elderly Care System** that integrates:

- **AI-based fall detection and prevention warnings using multi-camera (CCTV) feeds**
- **Personalized meal recommendation plans**
- **Safe exercise generation and monitoring tailored to physical conditions**

The system supports both **elder users** and **caregivers** through an intuitive interface and intelligent alerts.

## 🚀 Main Features

### 1️⃣ Meal Recommendation Plan 🥗

**Purpose:**  
Ensure proper nutrition tailored to elderly individuals, especially those with arthritis and limited mobility.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Personalized meal plans based on:
  - Age
  - Health conditions
  - Activity level
- Daily meal schedules (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- Hydration reminders
- Easy-to-follow recommendations

**Outcome:**  
✔ Improves nutrition  
✔ Supports joint health  
✔ Reduces caregiver burden

### 2️⃣ Fall Detection & Prevention 🚨

**Purpose:**  
Detect falls in real time and **prevent falls before they happen**.

**How it Works:**
- Activities captured through **CCTV cameras**
- AI model identifies:
  - Normal activities
  - Unstable movements
  - Near-fall situations
  - Actual falls

**Prevention Warnings (Displayed On-Screen):**
- “Please walk slowly”
- “Sit down for a moment”
- “Use nearby support”

**Critical Alerts:**
- Immediate caregiver notification
- Live camera access
- Emergency response options

**Outcome:**  
✔ Faster response time  
✔ Reduced fall incidents  
✔ Increased safety and confidence

### 3️⃣ Exercise Generator 🏃‍♂️

**Purpose:**  
Promote safe physical activity without increasing injury risk.

**Key Features:**
- Low-impact exercises designed for:
  - Arthritis
  - Limited mobility
- Exercises categorized by:
  - Difficulty level
  - Joint focus
- Duration-based routines
- Clear instructions and visuals

**Outcome:**  
✔ Maintains mobility  
✔ Reduces stiffness  
✔ Encourages healthy routine
